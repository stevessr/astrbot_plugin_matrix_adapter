# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Added `matrix_force_message_type=stalk` to archive incoming messages to per-room JSONL files under `store_path/stalk_archive/`.
- In `stalk` mode, messages are recorded but not dispatched to AstrBot handlers.
- Extended message type forcing to support `stalk` alongside `auto`/`private`/`group`.
